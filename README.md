# Nostr Bot Poster

These instructions will help you to get started with creating your own nostr bot to automate posting your predefined posts. Just follow: npub1wuj7ent0p42n9v8awdzl2sfanfj4u2k7dwz09ranqd7fwsz5qpgquc92rq to see it in action.

As an option, you can also setup a Telegram bot alert when you are running out of content to post.

## Pre-requsites

1. Noscl

We will use Noscl, Fiatjaf's command line client for Nostr. See here: https://github.com/fiatjaf/noscl
You can also use the following tutorial to set it up properly: https://habla.news/a/naddr1qqnkummnw3ez6ut4da6x2uedvfhhgtts096xsmmw94eksetvdskhvetj0ykk2ctn0yq3uamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3dwp6kytnhv4kxcmmjv3jhytnwv46z7qgwwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkctcpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujumn0wd68ytnzv9hxgtcpzdmhxue69uhk7enxvd5xz6tw9ec82c30qy0hwumn8ghj7mn0wd68yttjv4kxz7fwdehkkmm5v9ex7tnrdakj7q3q7rlc0emedw5xljztfqrmykjaacsx6ujvdas64zznjadrnhhwlavqxpqqqp65wvt7ddx

2. Python Telegram library

To get the library, run this command:
```
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

3. Telegram bot (https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial) - this is where you will get bot token and chat id


## The script

Grab the Python script in this repo and modify your Telegram data in it


## Automating the notifications
  
When the script correctly posts to Nostr and notifies you on Telegram, the next step is to automate it. 

Run the following command to open your crontab.

```
crontab -e
```

Add the following into it.

```
30 * * * * /ABSOLUTE PATH TO YOUR PYTHON FILE/./nostrpost.sh >> /ABSOLUTE PATH TO YOUR CRONLOG FILE 2>&1
```

Don't forget to replace the path to your python file and to the location where you want the log. 

This cron schedule will execute the specified command at the 30th minute of every hour.

# Extras

When you post a lot of content, maybe you'd like to style it, so it has a similar look and feel. For example: append something to each content or pre-pend some data. 
In the repo, you will also find a script: addtopost.py which will help you to do this in bulk.

# End Notes

Now go out there and create your own bot. Sky is the limit. It is by no means perfect, but it will do the job.
